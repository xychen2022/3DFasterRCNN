Use with caution! This code was NOT tested thoroughly because I have left my PhD university and lost the access to the data I used in the paper. In addition, I changed the code to make it compatible to phase 1 code I published before. Therefore, you may encounter unexpected errors.

I think even if you encountered errors, they should be easy to fix. Let me know if you found an error!
